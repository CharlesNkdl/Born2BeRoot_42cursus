## What is on the repo

As the project was made on a VM, i can't put it on GitHub, but i made a pretty thorough tutorial that you can read.
For the bonus, i only did the manual partitioning, as i was quite new to server.

This project will give you a good understanding of how to manage a Linux server and will prepare you for more advanced projects in system administration. Good luck!
